Constructed between the period of 2550 to 2490 B.C, it is the largest of all three pyramids with a base of about 230.4 metres, and a height of 146.5 metres.</p>

      <p class="heading"> Hanging Gardens Of Babylon</p>
      <p class="content">Though the ruins of Babylon are established in the city of Al-Hillah in Iraq currently, the existence of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon remains as mysterious as ever. It is believed that around 600 BC, King Nebuchadnezzar built the Hanging Gardens for his wife Amytis which did not really hang. However, this ancient wonder remains open to the speculations of historians who often find themselves blank due to the lack of evidence of any kind in Babylonian history.</p>

      <p class="heading"> Machu Picchu</p>
      <p class="content">Machu Picchu, an Incan city of sparkling granite precariously perched between two towering Andean peaks, is thought by scholars to have been a sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of Cusco. Built at the peak of the Incan Empire in the mid-1400s, this mountain citadel was later abandoned by the Incas. The site remained unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by archaeologist Hiram Bingham. The site can only be reached by foot, train or helicopter; most visitors visit by train from nearby Cusco.</p>

      <p class="heading">The Roman Colosseum (Rome)</p>
      <p class="content">Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum. Built between A.D. 70 and 80 A.D., it was in use for some 500 years. The elliptical structure sat nearly 50,000 spectators, who gathered to watch the gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles, including battle reenactments, animal hunts and executions. Earthquakes and stone-robbers have left the Colosseum in a state of ruin, but portions of the structure remain open to tourists, and its design still influences the construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later.</p>

      <p class="content">Brihadeeshwara Temple (Peruvudaiyar Kovil) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Thanjavur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajesvaram. It is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture during the Chola period. Built by emperor Raja Raja Chola I and completed in 1010 AD, the temple turned 1000 years old in 2010. The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the “Great Living Chola Temples”, with the other two being the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Airavatesvara temple.</p>

      <p class="heading">Petra, Jordan</p>
      <p class="content">We had been to a lot of ancient cities before we made our way to Petra. We thought we had seen it all until we walked through the 1.2km long siq (a narrow gorge with high rock walls reaching 80 meters into the air) leading to the incredible Treasury building. The journey was beautiful but once we arrived at the opening in the middle of a canyon, we gasped in awe. This ancient wonder was hidden from the outside world for centuries. It wasn’t until 1812 that it was “discovered” by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Since then the Lost City has become Jordan’s premier tourist attraction.</p>
